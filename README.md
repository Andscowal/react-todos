# react-todos

This is a simple todos app highlighting the simplicity of React when it comes to writing dynamic functions with 
a very small amount of code.

CSS styles were written inline as there isn't a need for too much styling, and it supports the lightweight usability
of our todos app!

This project exists primarily because I wanted to show the simplicity React offers when it comes to event handlers
and <strong>Stateless Functional Components</strong>.

Expect a blog post in the near future on <strong>Stateless Functional Components</strong> as they are an integral part of React and learning how
to utilize them will help you think like a developer, and if you put the fundamentals to practice, you'll write better code
in no time!

The post will be published on my personal blog, JavaScript Reaction, which can be found at <a href="http://jsrxn.com">jsrxn.com</a>.
